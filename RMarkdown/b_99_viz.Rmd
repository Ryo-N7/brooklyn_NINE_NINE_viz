"Hey there criminal. It's me, Johnny Law!" - Jake Peralta, NYPD.

Brooklyn Nine-Nine has become one of my favorite sitcoms in recent years, probably taking over from Parks & Recreation. So in this blog post, I'm going to web scrape some very simple statistics, clean it up with the `tidyverse`, and visualize it with `ggplot2`... 

"Terry loves `ggplot2`!"

- yippie-kayak other buckets!
- Noice. Toit.
- fine i was trying something and it didnt work! .gif

# Packages

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, rvest, glue, cowplot, ggbeeswarm,
               polite, extrafont, scales, gridExtra)
loadfonts() # "Univers" and "Univers LT 93 ExtraBlackEx" fonts
```

# B99 theme

First, let me create a custom Brooklyn NINE NINE theme that I can put on all of my plots. This will save me time from typing in the same options over and over again! I googled the font type that official Brooklyn Nine Nine media used, downloaded them, and got it installed for R using the `extrafont` package. For some of the different colors you'll see in the plots I sourced them from pasting in the Brooklyn Nine-Nine logo and other official media images into [imagecolorpicker.com](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en) and saving the hex codes that it gave me. Otherwise, I experimented with different palettes from perusing [Emil Hvitfeld's]() awesome [r-color-palettes](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes) Github repository (Also special thanks to [David Smale]() for giving me some advice on using color!).

```{r}
theme_b99 <- function(){
  
  base_size <- 11
  half_line <- base_size / 2
  
  theme_minimal() %+replace%
    theme(text = element_text(family = "Univers", color = "#F9FEFF",
                              face = "plain", size = 14, 
                              hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5, angle = 0,
                              lineheight = 0.9, 
                              margin = margin(half_line, half_line,
                                              half_line, half_line),
                              debug = FALSE),
          plot.title = element_text(family = "Univers LT 93 ExtraBlackEx",
                                    size = 20, color = "#F9FEFF"),
          plot.background = element_rect(color = NA, fill = "#0053CD"), 
          panel.background = element_rect(color = NA, fill = "#0053CD"),
          # axis options
          axis.text = element_text(family = "Univers", color = "#F9FEFF", size = 12),
          axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
          # legend options (for ratings plot)
          legend.title = element_text(family = "Univers", color = "#F9FEFF"),
          legend.text = element_text(family = "Univers", color = "#F9FEFF",
                                     size = 9),
          legend.position = "bottom",
          legend.key = element_rect(colour = "black", linetype = "solid", size = 1.5),
          legend.background = element_rect(color = "black", fill = "#0053CD",
                                           linetype = "solid"))
}
```

Now the plots will all look very similar.

With that done, I can start making plots!

# Episode ratings

Calling `as_tibble()` on a vector is discouraged, because the behavior is likely to change in the future. Use `enframe(name = NULL)` instead.

As in my more [recent]() blog posts I will use the `polite` package to web scrape responsibly (note the `bow()` and `scrape()` functions).

I `map_2()` over the IMDB page for the episodes for each season and I append the season number to each episode row. After I'm done with the webscraping I `mutate()` in the episode number for each season.

```{r}
url_df <- tibble(
  urls = c("https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2467372/episodes?season=1",
           "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2467372/episodes?season=2",
           "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2467372/episodes?season=3",
           "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2467372/episodes?season=4",
           "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2467372/episodes?season=5"),
  season_num = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) 

# scraping function:
brooklyn99_ep_rating <- function(url) {
  
  session <- bow(url)
  url2 <- scrape(session)
  
  # Grab episode names
  sX_ep_name <- url2 %>% 
    html_nodes(".info a") %>% 
    html_text() %>% 
    as_tibble() %>% 
    mutate(value = gsub("\\n", "", x = value))
  
  # Grab episode rating
  sX_rate <- url2 %>% 
    html_nodes(".ipl-rating-widget > .ipl-rating-star .ipl-rating-star__rating") %>% 
    html_text() %>% 
    as_tibble() %>%  
    mutate(rating = gsub("\\n", "", x = value) %>% as.numeric) %>% 
    select(-value)
  
  # Clean episode name df
  sX_ep_name <- sX_ep_name %>% 
    mutate(title = trimws(value)) %>% 
    filter(!str_detect(title, "Rate"), title != "") %>% 
    select(-value)
  
  # combine name + rating
  ep_rating <- sX_ep_name %>% 
    bind_cols(sX_rate)
}

ep_rating_df <- map2(.x = url_df$urls, .y = url_df$season_num,
                          ~ brooklyn99_ep_rating(url = .x) %>% 
         mutate(season = .y)) %>% 
  reduce(bind_rows)

saveRDS(ep_rating_df, "../data/ep_rating_df.RDS")
ep_rating_df <- readRDS("../data/ep_rating_df.RDS")

ep_rating_df <- ep_rating_df %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  mutate(ep_num = row_number()) %>% 
  ungroup()

glimpse(ep_rating_df)
```

OK, looks good.

## Episode Ratings Plot: Heatmap and boxplot

I used `geom_tile()` to create a heatmap of episode ratings with the season number as the rows and the episode number for that season as the columns. I used the `dichromat` package for the color scheme "LightBluetoDarkBlue.10", it meshes pretty well with the Brooklyn 99 color theme!

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
rating_plot <- ep_rating_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ep_num, y = season)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = rating), size = 1.5,
            color = "black") +
  scale_fill_gradientn("Rating", colors = dichromat::colorschemes$LightBluetoDarkBlue.10,
                       breaks = c(7.7, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5)) +
  guides(fill = guide_colourbar(frame.colour = "black",
                                barwidth = unit(2, "in"))) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.01, 0.01), 
                     breaks = c(1, seq(from = 5, to = 20, by = 5), 23),
                     labels = c(1, seq(from = 5, to = 20, by = 5), 23)) +
  scale_y_reverse(expand = c(0.01, 0.01),
                  breaks = c(1:7), 
                  labels = c(1:7)) +
  labs(x = "Episode Number", y = "Season",
       title = "Episode Ratings") +
  theme_b99() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())

rating_plot
```

From what we can see on the graph there doesn't seem to be any trends along either axes besides the fact that the finales and the subsequent opening episode of the following season are well-received. The two stand out episodes that can be cleary seen are from Season 5. These episodes are "" with  and ""  . 

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=7, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
rating_plot2 <- ep_rating_df %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  mutate(ep_num = row_number()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ep_num, y = season)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = rating), size = 1.5,
            color = "black") +
  scale_fill_gradientn("Rating", colors = dichromat::colorschemes$LightBluetoDarkBlue.10,
                       breaks = c(7.7, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5)) +
  guides(fill = guide_colourbar(frame.colour = "black",
                                barwidth = unit(2, "in"))) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.01, 0.01), 
                     breaks = c(1, seq(from = 5, to = 20, by = 5), 23),
                     labels = c(1, seq(from = 5, to = 20, by = 5), 23)) +
  scale_y_reverse(expand = c(0.01, 0.01),
                  breaks = c(1:7), 
                  labels = c(1:7)) +
  labs(x = "Episode Number", y = "Season",
       title = "Episode Ratings",
       caption = glue("
                      Source: IMDB
                      @R_By_Ryo")) +
  theme_b99() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())

rating_plot2
```

Another way to visualize this would be the boxplot. This way allows you to make a comparison between seasons, whereas the heatmap could be used to pick out any trends over time or sequence.

The debate between violin plot vs. box plot vs. sina plot vs. etc. rages on to this day (some examples I've read over the years: [1](https://cerebralmastication.com/2009/02/box-plot-vs-violin-plot-in-r/), [2](https://simplystatistics.org/2017/07/13/the-joy-of-no-more-violin-plots/), [3](https://rpubs.com/crazyhottommy/sina-plot)) and some of the arguments made seem to come down to personal preference. The data I'm using is quite small (~20 episode ratings for each season) so in my case it might be better to use boxplots (instead of violin plots) and sprinkle bee swarm points on top with the [ggbeeswarm](https://github.com/eclarke/ggbeeswarm) package! I commented out some of the other methods if you wanted to copy-paste this code chunk into your R console to try them out.

I highlighted the outliers for each season in red with the unintentional result being that the color scheme mimics that of the flag of Colorado...

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
cols <- c("1" = "#6CA9C3", "2" = "#3A3533", 
          "3" = "#000E33", "4" = "#CBCFD2", "5" = "#175E78")

ep_rating_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = rating, group = season)) +
  #geom_violin(color = "#F9FEFF", fill = "#000E33") +
  #ggthemes::geom_tufteboxplot(color = "#F9FEFF", fill = "#000E33") +
  #ggforce::geom_sina(color = "#F9FEFF", fill = "#000E33") +
  geom_boxplot(color = "#F9FEFF", fill = "#000E33",
              outlier.color = "red", outlier.size = 5) +
  geom_beeswarm(color = "#FCF40E", cex = 2, size = 2.25) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(7.5, 9.6),
                     labels = c(7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5)) +
  labs(title = "Episode Ratings by Season",
       x = "Season", y = "Rating") +
  theme_b99() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

Toit! We get the best of both worlds by combining two different types of visualizing distributions. Let's check out what the stand-out episodes are...

```{r}
ep_rating_df %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  top_n(n = 2, wt = rating) %>% 
  arrange(season, desc(rating))
```

Mostly end-of-season episodes just like what we saw in the heatmap.

It is very clear that the Halloween episodes are highly regarded (to those that rate B99 on IMDB).

A more recent variant for showing a distribution is the ridgeline plot (using the [ggridges]() package):

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
ep_rating_df %>% 
  mutate(season = as_factor(as.character(season))) -> ep_rating_df2

ep_rating_df2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = rating, y = season, height = ..density..)) +
  ggridges::geom_density_ridges(color = "#F9FEFF", fill = "#000E33") +
  labs(title = "Episode Ratings by Season",
       x = "Rating", y = "Season") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(7.25, 9.8),
                     breaks = c(7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5),
                     labels = c(7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5)) +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev(levels(ep_rating_df2$season))) +
  theme_b99() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

Well OK, they're just box plots but I wanted to use this GIF in some capacity! 

# Cast appearances

The main cast of B99 are pretty tightly knit and as members of the same precinct it makes sense that they'll generally appear together. So I wanted to look at what non-main cast members and guests made the most appearances on the show. Special note: Hitchcock and Scully weren't officially "main cast" until Season 2 but I left them out of the non-main cast list.

Finally I `anti_join()` the main cast list from the full cast list so I am left with the non-main cast and the number of episodes taht they appeared in.

```{r}
# Entire cast:
cast_url <- bow("https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2467372/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast")

cast_info_raw <- scrape(cast_url) %>% 
  html_nodes(".character") %>% 
  html_text() %>% 
  as_tibble()

cast_info_clean <- cast_info_raw %>% 
  separate(value, into = c("blank", "name", "episode_num", "dots"), sep = "\n") %>% 
  mutate(episode_num = case_when(
    episode_num == "         / ...  " ~ dots,
    TRUE ~ episode_num),
    episode_num = episode_num %>% word(., 1, sep = "e") %>% as.numeric,
    name = str_trim(name, side = "both")) %>% 
  select(-blank, -dots) %>% 
  mutate(name = case_when(
    name == "Captain Ray Holt" ~ "Ray Holt",
    name == "Scully" ~ "Norm Scully",
    name == "Hitchcock" ~ "Michael Hitchcock",
    name == "Deputy Chief Madeline Wuntch" ~ "Madeline Wuntch",
    TRUE ~ name))
  
# Main cast:
cast_main_url <- bow("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Brooklyn_Nine-Nine_characters")

cast_main_raw <- scrape(cast_main_url) %>% 
  html_nodes(".wikitable") %>% 
  html_table(fill = TRUE) %>% 
  flatten_df() %>% 
  as_tibble()

cast_main_clean <- cast_main_raw %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  select(Character)

# save
#saveRDS(cast_info_clean, "../data/cast_info_clean.RDS")
cast_info_clean <- readRDS("../data/cast_info_clean.RDS")

#saveRDS(cast_main_clean, "../data/cast_main_clean.RDS")
cast_main_clean <- readRDS("../data/cast_main_clean.RDS")

# anti-join
non_main_cast <- anti_join(cast_info_clean, cast_main_clean, by = c("name" = "Character"))
```

## Non-Main Cast Appearances Plot

To shorten the list I'll just look at the top five cast members. I create a "halfway" variable so that the number labels will appear right in the middle of each bar. Using the `axis_canvas()`, `draw_image()`, and `insert_axis_grob()` from the `cowplot` package I can insert images of the characters along the bottom of the plot.

```{r fig.height = 6, fig.width = 10}
non_main_plot <- non_main_cast %>% 
  arrange(desc(episode_num)) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  mutate(halfway = episode_num / 2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(name, desc(episode_num)), y = episode_num)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#000E33") +
  geom_text(aes(y = halfway, label = episode_num,
                family = "Univers"),
            color = "#F9FEFF",
            size = 8) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 12.5),
                     breaks = c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12),
                     labels = c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12)) +
  labs(title = "Most appearances by non-main cast", 
       x = NULL, y = "Number of Episodes") +
  theme_b99() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank())

# images

# insert the image strip into the bar plot and draw  
ncast_plot <- ggdraw(insert_xaxis_grob(non_main_plot, pimage, position = "bottom"))

```

Adrian has appeared in the most episodes just beating out Kevin. This really shows how involved Adrian was in the story in Season 4 and 5 especially compared to Kevin who has periodically appeared since the first season. Everybody's favorite DOUG JUDY rounds off this bar chart.

Pretty much the same M.O. as what I did to get the episode ratings here. One thing of note was using regex to get rid of the footnotes. I had to be careful to double escape the square brackets there.

A little intermission here as I wanted to talk about this cool package I recently found on Twitter called [tidylog](https://github.com/elbersb/tidylog). To show you an example, I will take a look at which writers wrote the most episodes in Season 5:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidylog)

ep_info_df %>% 
  select(season, num_season, title, num_overall, writer, viewers) %>% 
  filter(season == 5) %>% 
  separate_rows(writer, sep = "&") %>% 
  mutate(writer = writer %>% trimws) %>% 
  group_by(writer) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

You can see that it gives you details on what each `dplyr` function changed in your dataframe in the order that the operations were performed. It's pretty cool and it gets more useful as your `dplyr` pipeline grows longer! Let's turn tidylog off for now:

```{r}
options("tidylog.display" = list())
```


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ep_info_df %>% 
  select(season, num_season, title, num_overall, director, viewers) %>% 
  separate_rows(director, sep = "&") %>% 
  mutate(director = director %>% trimws) %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(),
            avg_viewers = mean(viewers)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_viewers))

# yellow: #FCF40E
# dark grey: #3A3533
# light teal: #6CA9C3
# black: #0F0E0E
# navy: #175E78
```

## Viewers Plot

The episode info dataframe we got from Wikipedia had a lot of different information so let's chop it down a bit to get a dataframe on the number of viewers per episode.

From what we saw from `glimpse()`-ing the `ep_info_df` earlier the data looked pretty clean already... except for "The Fugitive" episodes being formatted differently... 

![WHYYYY.gif](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc01463acbe445711497b5c979b996d1/tumblr_ov5bc3udjC1ty7lb2o1_540.gif) 

There are other multi-part episodes throughout the show but this pair is the only one that aired on the same day, on New Years Day 2017 so they got smushed together in the Wikipedia table when we scraped it. There wasn't a quick and easy way to `regex` them into separate rows so I just filtered them out and added them back in.

Then at the end of the pipe, I create a `first` and `last` variable for each season taking note of what overall episode number the first and last episodes of each season were. You'll see why I did this soon.

```{r fig.height = 4, fig.width = 10}
viewers_df <- ep_info_df %>% 
  select(season, num_season, title, num_overall, viewers) %>% 
  # manually fix "The Fugitive" episodes
  filter(num_overall != 7980) %>% 
  add_row(season = 4, num_season = 11, title = "The Fugitive: Part 1", 
          num_overall = 79, viewers = 3.49) %>% 
  add_row(season = 4, num_season = 12, title = "The Fugitive: Part 2", 
          num_overall = 80, viewers = 3.49) %>% 
  mutate(num_overall = as.numeric(num_overall),
         num_season = as.numeric(num_season),
         season = as_factor(as.character(season))) %>% 
  arrange(num_overall) %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  mutate(first = first(num_overall),
         last = last(num_overall)) %>% 
  ungroup() 
```

For this plot I use `geom_rect()` to give a colored background for each season. Setting the span of the Xs as the `first` and `last` episode number of each season and then using `Inf` and `-Inf` for the Ys to cover the entire height of the plot.

For the season labels I calculated the midpoint along the x-axis forr each season and used that as the x values (not shown in the code). I could have used facets but to the best of my knowledge I wouldn't have been able to place the labels on top across multiple facets anyways. It may be possible by placing text grobs on top of the facetted plot but I thought that would take more time compared to what I did with `geom_rect()`. Otherwise I use a lot of `annotate()` code to add in the episode details and season titles.

```{r fig.height = 6, fig.width = 11}
# fig.height=12, fig.width=16

# Color hex codes for season blocks:
cols <- c("1" = "#6CA9C3", "2" = "#3A3533", 
          "3" = "#000E33", "4" = "#CBCFD2", "5" = "#175E78")

viewer_plot <- viewers_df %>%

viewer_plot
```

I added in details on why certain episodes had such high viewership compared to others from both my memory and a little digging but I wasn't really sure about those three peaks in Season 3. One of them was a **Halloween** episode which is up there with the **Pontiac Bandit** episodes for the best recurring episodes but in terms of the actual airing dates I can't quite remember anything significant happening on those days that would explain the high viewer numbers (relative to the other episodes in the season).

With the presence of some outliers (notably the post-Super Bowl episode) it's probably better to look at the median rather than the mean.

```{r}
viewers_df %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  summarize(avg_viewers = median(viewers))

viewers_df %>% summarize(med = median(viewers))

viewers_df %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  summarize(avg_viewers = mean(viewers))

viewers_df %>% summarize(med = mean(viewers))
```

Throughout it's run on FOX the show averaged around 2-3.4 million viewers with numerous peaks and troughs until the 5th season where it only averaged around 1.8 million viewers but kept those numbers very consistently across the entire season. Due to that consistency you can see that the mean and median values are pretty similar to each other.

# Creating the title card

The last thing I want to do to wrap this blog post up is to create an infographic containing the plots I made above. Before I combine them all I want to make a title card that looks as similar to the official Brooklyn Nine Nine title card you see at the beginning of the episode. I used `geom_polygon()` to construct the two diagonal colored bars and then placed the text on top of them. 

```{r fig.width = 12, fig.height = 5.5}
#library(shadowtext)
# fig.height=12, fig.width=16

rect <- data.frame(id = as.factor(c(1, 1, 1, 1,
                          2, 2, 2, 2)),
                   x = c(12, 12, 0,  0,
                         12, 12, 5.1,  4.9),
                   y = c(5.1, 2, 0.4,  3.5,
                         2.3, 0.95, 0,  1.3))

header <- ggplot(data = rect, aes(x, y, group = id, fill = id)) +
  geom_polygon() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#0053CD", "#000E33"), guide = FALSE) +
  annotate(geom = "text", y = 2, x = 0.4, hjust = 0,
           family = "Univers LT 93 ExtraBlackEx", 
           color = "#fcf7e8", size = 35, angle = 7.5,
           label = glue("
                        BROOKLYN")) +
  annotate(geom = "text", y = 0.7, x = 5.25, hjust = 0,
           family = "Univers", 
           color = "#fcf7e8", size = 25, angle = 7.5,
           label = glue("
                        NINE-NINE")) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 12)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 5.5)) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(color = "#F9FEFF", 
                                       fill = "#F9FEFF", 
                                       size = 8))

header
```

NOICE TOIT

![]()

```{r}
?cowplot::plot_grid()
grid::textGrob()
grid::circleGrob()
```

## Arrange plots with grid

Now for the coup-de-grace, arranging all of the plots and the title card together to create a Brooklyn Nine Nine infographic!

```{r fig.height=12, fig.width=16}
grid.arrange(
  ncast_plot,
  rating_plot,
  viewer_plot,
  header,
  heights = c(1, 1, 0.05, 1),
  widths = c(2, 2, 0.1, 2, 2),
  layout_matrix = rbind(c(4, 4, 4, 4, 4),
                        c(1, 1, NA, 2, 2),
                        c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA),
                        c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3))
)
```

# Conclusion

In this blog post I went over creating your own custom `ggplot2` theme, web scraping, cleaning and tidying dataframes with the `tidyverse`, and creating a variety of plots to show simple statistics on Brooklyn Nine Nine. To conclude I just wanted to list out my top five "Cold Opens" (in no particular order):

- Halloween: Boyle == Denis Stojko
- THE FULL BULL PEN
- HOT DAMN! ![]()
- Holt wearing a red hat to work.
- "I came down with a Dianne Weast infection..."

Agree? Disagree? Let me know in the comments below!

I hope you had as much fun reading this as I did making it. If you didn't, then well...
